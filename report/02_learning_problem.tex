\section{Learning problem}
\label{sec:learning-problem}

We want to understand the relationships of 6 given genes: \texttt{ATP2B4}, \texttt{NAP1L1}, \texttt{MDK}, \texttt{PCCB}, \texttt{MDS1}, \texttt{AML}.
Each gene can be active or inactive and can influence the status of the others.
We are interested in predicting the probability of gene \texttt{AML} to be active, given the status of the others.

First, we will learn a Bayesian network using one of the algorithms described in \cref{sec:introduction}.
Then, we will use the build in \ac{EM} algorithm to learn the model's parameters.
Finally, we will evaluate the network's performances on predicting gene \texttt{AML}.

We are given dataset that contains \num{72} complete examples of the \num{6} genes.
We will use \num{80}\% of them for the training and the remaining \num{20}\% for the test.
Given the small number of examples, we will use the k-fold cross validation technique (explained in \cref{sec:cross-validation}) to get more reliable results.
