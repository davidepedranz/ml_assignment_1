\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

On this learning problem, the fixed Naive Bayes structure performed significantly better than the networks learned with both NPC and Greedy search-and-score.
Naive Bayes classifiers should considered if the training set is small and thus does not contain enough information to learn a good structure.
The network structure of a Naive Bayes classifier is simpler than the structure learned from the data and may perform better in some cases.
If the random variables are known to be independent on each other given the class, then the Naive Bayes approach should be preferred.
